# Rose Bakeshop (Frontend-only E-Commerce)

This project is a frontend-only e-commerce web app built for IT-101.
## Nino Piedad & David Cinco
## Pages
- Home: `index.html`
- Products (listing): `products.html`
- Product details: `product.html?id=<product-id>`
- Cart: `cart.html`
- Checkout: `checkout.html`
- Menu (slider): `menu.html`

## Notes
- No backend is used.
- Products are dummy data in `data.js`.
- Cart uses `localStorage`.

## How to run locally
Open `index.html` using a local server (recommended) so navigation works properly:
- VS Code: Live Server extension
- or any static server

## HCI features included
- Consistent UI components and layout
- Cart badge shows system status
- Toast feedback for actions (Add/Remove/Clear)
- Error prevention (disabled Place order until required fields are filled)
- Form hints and inline validation
- Responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, desktop
